Project Description:
We are designing a simple 1 to 2-minute game about the Osprey and the Northern Harrier.
The player will choose one.
If they choose the Osprey, they will go on a journey above the water, collecting fish as they go.
If they choose the Harrier, they will wander their local area and hunt for prey by following soundwaves.
